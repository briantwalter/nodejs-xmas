Some very hackish code to display a near-realtime Mjpeg stream coming off of a Raspberry Pi running motion and simple controls to another Raspberry Pi running WebIOPi and controlling a relay for the roof lights.

Added some client side javascript as to not have to refresh the page and potentially get a timeout on the live graphic.
